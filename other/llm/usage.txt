this is my abstract for the paper:  "This paper analyzes the cause of hate crime. the statistic shows the count of hate crime due to different bias catogrory. It shows that most hate crimes were towrad Jewish, Female, and Black people, and that the occurence of hate crime is increasing each year. This finding suggest that..." modify my abstract so it meet the standard of following: first sentence: specify the general area of the paper and encourage the reader; second sentence: specify the dataset and methods at a general level; third sentence: specify the headline result; and a fourth sentence about implications. An abstract is included and appropriately pitched to a non-specialist audience. The abstract answers: 1) what was done, 2) what was found, and 3) why this matters (all at a high level). Likely four sentences. Abstract must make clear what we learn about the world because of this paper.

ChatGPT
This paper explores the critical issue of hate crimes and their underlying causes, highlighting the urgent need for societal awareness and intervention. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of hate crime incidents, we employed statistical methods to analyze the counts attributed to various bias categories. Our findings reveal that the majority of hate crimes are directed toward Jewish, female, and Black individuals, with a concerning trend of increasing occurrences over the years. These results underscore the importance of understanding hate crimes to inform policies and initiatives aimed at fostering inclusivity and reducing discrimination in our communities.

here is my intro: A hate crime is a criminal offence committed against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or gender identity or expression or any other similar factor. In this paper, data of hate crime in Toronto is used to analyze the cause of hate crime: what are the most frequent reasons for hate crime, which race, ethnicity, region, sexual orientation,and gender the victim is mostly expeirenced hate crime. modify it so it meet the following standarnd: An introduction needs to be self-contained and convey everything that a reader needs to know. We are not writing a mystery story. Instead, we want to give away the most important points in the introduction. For a ten-to-fifteen-page paper, an introduction may be two or three paragraphs of main content. Hayot (2014, 90) says the goal of an introduction is to engage the reader, locate them in some discipline and background, and then tell them what happens in the rest of the paper. It should be completely reader-focused.

The introduction should set the scene and give the reader some background. For instance, we typically start a little broader. This provides some context to the paper. We then describe how the paper fits into that context, and give some high-level results, especially focused on the one key result that is the main part of the story. We provide more detail here than we provided in the abstract, but not the full extent. And we broadly discuss next steps in a sentence or two. Finally, we finish the introduction with an additional short final paragraph that highlights the structure of the paper. The introduction is self-contained and tells a reader everything they need to know including: 1) broader context to motivate; 2) some detail about what the paper is about; 3) a clear gap that needs to be filled; 4) what was done; 5) what was found; 6) why it is important; 7) the structure of the paper. A reader should be able to read only the introduction and know what was done, why, and what was found. Likely 3 or 4 paragraphs, or 10 per cent of total. 

The remainder of this paper is stuctured as follow: 2.1 Explain data source and variable, 2.2 explained the process of clean data, 2.3 display the data in figure, 3 result, 4 discussion, 5 appendix

Here’s your introduction revised to meet the standards you provided:

Hate crimes are criminal offenses directed at individuals or property, driven by bias, prejudice, or hatred based on factors such as race, ethnicity, language, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other similar characteristics. These crimes are a serious societal issue, as they target specific groups and reinforce divisions. In recent years, cities like Toronto have witnessed a rise in reported hate crimes, prompting a need to analyze the underlying causes and trends. Understanding the motivations behind hate crimes and identifying the most affected communities is critical for developing targeted prevention strategies and fostering a more inclusive society.

This paper utilizes data on hate crimes reported in Toronto to explore the causes behind these offenses. Specifically, it investigates the most frequent motivations for hate crimes, including race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity. By analyzing which demographic groups are most often victimized, this paper aims to shed light on patterns of bias in hate crimes and how these trends have evolved over time. The analysis reveals that Black, Jewish, and female individuals are disproportionately targeted, and the occurrence of hate crimes has been increasing each year.

The importance of this study lies in its ability to inform policymakers, law enforcement, and the public about the prevalence and nature of hate crimes in Toronto. Addressing the root causes of these offenses is essential for reducing their occurrence and protecting vulnerable communities. 

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the data sources and variables, as well as the process of cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. Section 3 presents the results, including visualizations of key trends, while Section 4 provides a discussion of the findings. Finally, Section 5 includes appendices with additional details and supporting material.

This revised version follows a clear structure, provides context, and gives away the most important findings, focusing on why this paper is valuable.

can i do race_bias <- sample(c(unique(cleaned_data$RACE_BIAS)) when simulate data

ChatGPT
Yes, you can use sample() along with unique() to simulate data by randomly sampling from the unique categories in RACE_BIAS. Here's how you can do it when simulating a column for RACE_BIAS:

# Simulate the RACE_BIAS column by sampling from the unique values in cleaned_data$RACE_BIAS
set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility

simulated_race_bias <- sample(unique(cleaned_data$RACE_BIAS), size = nrow(cleaned_data), replace = TRUE)

# Add the simulated RACE_BIAS column to your dataset or create a new simulated dataset
simulated_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(RACE_BIAS = simulated_race_bias)

# Check the first few rows of the simulated data
head(simulated_data)

can i get a summary of count of occurence for different bias by each year

ChatGPT
Yes, you can get a summary of the count of occurrences for different bias types by each year using group_by() in combination with summarize() from the dplyr package. This will group the data by year and then calculate the counts of occurrences for each bias category within those groups.

Here's an example of how to do it for different bias categories by each year:

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Summarize the counts of occurrences for different bias categories by year
bias_summary_by_year <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(OCCURRENCE_YEAR) %>%
  summarize(
    race_bias_count = sum(RACE_BIAS != "None"),
    ethnicity_bias_count = sum(ETHNICITY_BIAS != "None"),
    religion_bias_count = sum(RELIGION_BIAS != "None"),
    gender_bias_count = sum(GENDER_BIAS != "None"),
    sexual_orientation_bias_count = sum(SEXUAL_ORIENTATION_BIAS != "None"),
    disability_bias_count = sum(MENTAL_OR_PHYSICAL_DISABILITY != "None")
  )

The data is from Open House Toronto (citation).This dataset includes all verified Hate Crime occurrences investigated by the Hate Crime Unit by reported date since 2018. The Hate Crime categories (bias categories) include Age, Mental or Physical Disability, Race, Ethnicity, Language, Religion, Sexual Orientation, Gender and Other Similar Factor.(citation)
This data only includes confirmed hate crimes. This data does not include occurrences that have been deemed unfounded or classified as hate incidents.(citation)
The dataset is intended to provide communities with information regarding public safety and awareness. The location of Hate Crime occurrences have been grouped to the neighbourhood level to protect the privacy of parties and communities involved in the occurrence.These are the variables in the cleaned data: EVENT_UNIQUE_ID is the id for each offence, OCCURRENCE_YEAR shows the year offence occur, OCCURRENCE_DATE shows the exact date the offence occur, MENTAL_OR_PHYSICAL_DISABILITY shows whether offence occur due to basis of the Suspect’s perception of the Victim’s mental or physical disability. RACE_BIAS shows the race of the victim for Hate Crime committed on the basis of the Suspect’s perception of the Victim’s race. ETHNICITY_BIAS shows the the ethnicity of the victim for Hate Crime committed on the basis of the Suspect’s perception of the Victim’s ethnicity. LANGUAGE_BIAS shows the language of the victim speeks for Hate Crime committed on the basis of the Suspect’s perception of the Victim’s language. RELIGION_BIAS shows the religion of the victim for Hate Crime committed on the basis of the Suspect’s perception of the Victim’s religion. SEXUAL_ORIENTATION_BIAS shows the sexual orientation of the victim for Hate Crime committed on the basis of the Suspect’s perception of the Victim’s sexual orientation. GENDER_BIAS shows the the gender of the victim for Hate Crime committed on the basis of the Suspect’s perception of the Victim’s gender. No other dataset is used because this one is publish by Toronto Police officially. This is how the data is cleaned: All variables that is removed expect for AGE_BIAS is removed since they are irrlevant to the analysis. variable AGE_BIAS is removed since it contained constant "None" value which indicated that hate crime usually happen not just becuase of victim's age. Then, "No" in the MENTAL_OR_PHYSICAL_DISABILITY colmn is changed to "None" for staying consistancy with other column.  modify this so it satisfies the following: The data section should thoroughly and precisely discuss the source of the data and the broader context that gave rise to it (ethical, statistical, and otherwise). A sense of the dataset should be communicated to the reader. The broader context of the dataset should be discussed. All variables should be thoroughly examined and explained. Explain if there were similar datasets that could have been used and why they were not. If variables were constructed then this should be mentioned, and high-level cleaning aspects of note should be mentioned, but this section should focus on the destination, not the journey.

ChatGPT
Data Overview
The dataset for this analysis is sourced from Open Data Toronto, specifically from the Toronto Police Service’s verified Hate Crime occurrences. It records all confirmed hate crimes that have been investigated by the Hate Crime Unit since 2018, categorized by their reported date. Notably, the dataset only includes verified hate crimes and excludes incidents that were unfounded or classified merely as hate incidents.

The dataset serves an important societal purpose, providing communities with detailed information to enhance public safety and awareness about hate crimes in Toronto. The data categories, referred to as bias categories, capture various dimensions of prejudice that are present in hate crimes, such as age, mental or physical disability, race, ethnicity, language, religion, sexual orientation, and gender. These categories allow researchers to analyze the prevalence of bias in different forms, offering a structured view of hate crime patterns over time.

This dataset is invaluable for understanding hate crimes within the city, but it also comes with ethical considerations. Since each data point represents a real-world event, we must recognize the harm experienced by individuals and communities due to these crimes. Additionally, it’s important to acknowledge that the dataset focuses on confirmed hate crimes, which means it only represents cases where sufficient evidence was gathered. While this strengthens the reliability of the data, it also limits the scope of the analysis to known and proven crimes. Furthermore, the geographic locations of the incidents are aggregated to the neighborhood level to protect the privacy of the victims and communities involved.

The data is composed of several key variables relevant to this analysis:

EVENT_UNIQUE_ID: A unique identifier for each recorded hate crime.
OCCURRENCE_YEAR: The year when the crime took place.
OCCURRENCE_DATE: The exact date of the crime.
MENTAL_OR_PHYSICAL_DISABILITY: Indicates whether the crime was motivated by the suspect’s perception of the victim’s mental or physical disability.
RACE_BIAS: The victim’s race as perceived by the suspect, used as the basis for the crime.
ETHNICITY_BIAS: The victim’s ethnicity as perceived by the suspect.
LANGUAGE_BIAS: The victim’s language as perceived by the suspect.
RELIGION_BIAS: The victim’s religion as perceived by the suspect.
SEXUAL_ORIENTATION_BIAS: The victim’s sexual orientation as perceived by the suspect.
GENDER_BIAS: The victim’s gender as perceived by the suspect.
Alternative datasets were considered but were not used in this analysis. This particular dataset was chosen because it is published by the Toronto Police Service and provides verified, official data on hate crimes, making it more reliable than other possible datasets from unofficial sources. Including additional datasets could introduce inconsistency or unreliability, so this analysis focuses solely on this verified source.

Data Cleaning
The dataset underwent several cleaning steps to ensure its relevance and consistency for analysis. Several variables were removed as they were either irrelevant to the current analysis or did not add value. These included neighborhood-level geographic identifiers (e.g., NEIGHBOURHOOD_140, NEIGHBOURHOOD_158), reporting times and dates (REPORTED_TIME, REPORTED_DATE), and any variables related to the classification or reporting of multiple biases. Specifically, AGE_BIAS was removed because it contained only the constant value “None,” suggesting that hate crimes in this dataset are rarely motivated solely by the victim’s age.

Additionally, the MENTAL_OR_PHYSICAL_DISABILITY variable, which initially used "No" to denote a lack of bias, was modified to use "None" instead to maintain consistency with the other bias columns. No new variables were constructed, but this cleaning process ensured that the dataset was aligned and ready for analysis focused on the key bias categories.

make it better: @table-1 is a summary statistic of the cleaned data. it shows in each year, the number of each type of bias that the hate crime is commited to, as well as the total occurence for each type of bias, and total occurence of hate crime each year. From here we can see, there are arround 250 hate crime occurre each year for the past 6 year in Toronto, with crime toward Religion bias has the most

ChatGPT:
@table-1 provides a detailed summary statistic of the cleaned data, illustrating the number of hate crimes committed each year, categorized by specific bias types, along with the total occurrences for each category and the overall total of hate crimes annually. The table indicates that, on average, there are approximately 250 hate crime incidents reported each year in Toronto over the past six years. Notably, incidents motivated by religious bias consistently represent the highest proportion among the various bias types, underscoring a significant area of concern for community safety and policy interventions. This data highlights not only the prevalence of hate crimes but also the specific biases that warrant focused attention and resources for prevention and support initiatives.

ChatGPT:
The figure @fig-yearly-occurrence illustrates the annual occurrences of hate crimes from 2018 to 2022. The data indicates a clear upward trend in the number of reported hate crimes over this period. Starting from approximately 250 occurrences in 2018, there is a steady increase each year, culminating in a significant rise to over 400 occurrences in 2022.

This trend may suggest a growing prevalence of hate crimes within the community, possibly influenced by various social, political, and economic factors. Additionally, it could reflect an increase in public awareness and reporting of such incidents, as societal attitudes toward hate crimes continue to evolve. This increase raises important questions about the underlying causes and necessitates further investigation into the factors contributing to the rise in these offenses.

Overall, the increasing trend in hate crime occurrences highlights the importance of ongoing efforts in awareness, prevention, and intervention strategies to address the root causes of hate-driven behavior in society.

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) and i need to analyze it. This is some of my idea to start: @fig-occurrence-by-bias shows the total occurence of hate crime over the 6 year, categrorized by type of bias. From here we can see that most hate crime reported is toward ethnicity bias, while the least hate crime repotted is toward disability. However, this could be bias in mesurement since people with disability might be more difficult to report crime

the following artical focus on disability hate crime but also related it to religion hate crime: I’ve been working on a PhD on disability hate crime since 2009 and although it has become a developing area, our understanding of it remains in its infancy and the numbers of academic researchers pursuing this topic, whilst increasing, remain small.  During this period I’ve conducted focus groups, interviews and an online survey with victims of disability hate crimes and (along with other academics) I’ve noted some unique – or at least nuanced – features that occur within disability-specific hate crimes, when comparing it with other strands. I think that these features, which are particular to disability hate, have made it more difficult to recognise, respond to, and report disability hate crimes, meaning the figures may remain low for years to come and potentially making a true picture of disablist crime an impossibility. use the info in this article to modify: @fig-occurrence-by-bias presents the total occurrences of hate crimes over the past six years, categorized by the type of bias involved. The data reveals that the most frequently reported hate crimes are motivated by ethnicity bias, which indicates a significant concern for ethnically targeted offenses within the community. In contrast, hate crimes related to disability bias are the least reported.

This discrepancy may not solely reflect the actual prevalence of such crimes but could also indicate potential biases in measurement and reporting. Individuals with disabilities may face unique barriers to reporting hate crimes, including fear of stigma, lack of accessibility in reporting mechanisms, or difficulties in communication. Therefore, the lower numbers for disability bias should be interpreted with caution, as they may underrepresent the true extent of hate crimes targeting this vulnerable group. 

Overall, this analysis highlights the need for enhanced awareness and tailored support systems to ensure that all types of bias are recognized and addressed effectively. Efforts to improve reporting mechanisms and increase public awareness of hate crimes, particularly those against marginalized groups, are essential in combating such offenses and promoting a more inclusive society.

The misleading image of the stranger

The image of the hate crime perpetrator as stranger is a dominant one, despite research telling us that few crimes are committed by absolute strangers (e.g. Roberts et al, 2013; Mason, 2005). While this is true for all types of hate crimes, the literature – and my own research – appears to suggest that disability-related crimes are more likely than other strands to involve someone known to the victim (e.g. Action for Blind People, 2008; DRC 2004; Scope, 2011). Indeed, my findings have identified perpetrators as both ‘stranger’ (a complete unknown) and ‘familiar’ (such as a neighbour).  However, if a relationship exists between offender and victim, it is less likely to be recognised as a hate crime, which has implications for potential prosecution of disability cases. And unfortunately, in many cases of disability hate crime the relationship goes further than just someone ‘known’ to the victim, such as a neighbour, and may be one of friends, family members or carers (Roulstone & Mason-Bish, 2013; Chakraborti & Garland, 2009). As a consequence, victims are less likely to report offences from someone they know, as issues of dependency and unequal power relations can come into play (Sin and colleagues, 2009b).

The ‘groomed’ victim

Disability hate crime has identified new forms of incident and offences where perpetrators groom their disabled victims by developing a ‘friendship’ or dependent relationship with them. Usually referred to as ‘mate crime’, this occurs most frequently for those with learning disabilities. It’s thought to happen because some disabled people are isolated from those who care about them, leading to a desire for relationships, friends and company (Thomas, 2013). The so-called ‘friendship’ that is developed can lead to confusion, however, in that it can appear the abuse is consensual, and victims can be reluctant to report their experiences, as they may have few other friends. They even report ‘positive’ pay offs in some cases, such as a social life and companionship.  Landman (2014) cites ‘known, trusted’ perpetrators in many cases of mate crime involving people with learning disabilities, meaning the abuse is highly unlikely to be reported, or recognised, as hate crime.

A hidden crime

Linked to the previous point, it’s noteworthy that, whereas, say, religious hate attacks can often represent an attack on a community (for example targeting a mosque; e.g. Dodd, 2013), and one which has a limited capacity to respond, disabled people are often isolated, not part of a community, and have little opportunity to respond (Thomas, 2013). In addition to this, they can be targeted by opportunistic acts of hostility, which may not be criminal but have psychological and emotional consequences. Certain offences can also occur in private, such as residential homes (Mason-Bish, 2013), making it more difficult to recognise and report incidents. These elements combine to make recognising and reporting of disability hate crimes ever more challenging.

Increased likelihood of extreme abuse, violence and sexual assault

A distressing finding from research into disability hate crime suggests that torture, degradation and exploitation are common to many cases.  Although disablist offences can and do involve theft or vandalism, a significant proportion is ‘particularly sadistic’ and some result in the death of the victim (Sherry, 2013). Sexual degradation, rape and dehumanisation is often present and disabled people are more likely to experience sustained attacks involving excessive violence, cruelty, humiliation and degrading treatment, often related to their disability (e.g. see CPS, 2010b; Action for Blind People, 2008; Khalifeh and colleagues, 2013; Pettitt and colleagues, 2013). The level of dehumanisation and humiliation experienced by disability hate crimes victims appears to be over and above that reported by other strands.

Barriers to reporting

Added to all of the points above is the very practical barrier of accessing the police service. Because of the nature of certain disabilities, victims may have difficulty getting to, into and out of police buildings, or even simply being understood; again, not usually something that occurs with other strands.  Apart from the practicalities of accessing buildings, many victims also report having poor previous experience with the police, often because of negative stereotypes; in particular, those with mental health conditions or learning disabilities (Sin, 2015).  Overall, I and other researchers have found victims disappointed with previous police responses, which is often linked to lack of disability awareness generally. Many had low expectations of any form of response (Action for Blind People, 2008; Vincent et al, 2009; ECDP, 2010; Sin, 2013).

The ‘vulnerability’ trap

Lastly, a word about vulnerability.  This is a contentious term within disablist hate debates as there is a distinct difference between disability and the other strands when it comes to describing or perceiving victims as ‘vulnerable’. Mason-Bish (2013) rightly points out that “one of the key barriers to correctly identifying disability hate crime lies in the perceived difference between hatred and vulnerability” (p15). However, the debate about vulnerability versus hatred is a crucial one as current law sees hate crime as distinct to crimes targeted at those perceived to be ‘vulnerable’. Thus if a crime is perceived as involving a ‘vulnerable’ victim, the potential for establishing a hate motivation is severely reduced. As many of those who experience hate crime are obviously and visibly disabled or are known to their attackers as having an impairment, a challenge has been the existing inherent legal contradiction between constructions of hate (or hostility) and vulnerability (Roulstone & Sadique, 2013). And a construction of disabled people as vulnerable has weakened rather than strengthened the movement towards hate crime provisions. Whilst some scholars would argue that ‘vulnerability’ and ‘difference’ are central to hate crime (e.g. Chakraborti & Garland, 2012), the term vulnerability has connotations of weakness.  Furthermore, situations where victims are presented as ‘vulnerable’ may not be taken as seriously or may be interpreted as safe-guarding or adult protection issues (instead of criminal), leaving victims open to further abuse and denying them the right to be taken seriously (Roulstone & Sadique, 2013). The risk of repeat offences is arguably greater in a social care rather than criminal justice response.

So the obstacles to increasing reporting of disablist crimes remain. We need to challenge existing stereotypes around vulnerability and certain forms of disability and impairments. We need to improve access to reporting stations. We must encourage more victims to report offences committed by those close to them, a particular problem because of the relationships, degradation and exploitation that occur. Until this is achieved, I fear we will continue to see limited success in disability hate crime cases.
  
ChatGPT:
@fig-occurrence-by-bias presents the total occurrences of hate crimes over the past six years, categorized by the type of bias involved. The data indicates that the most frequently reported hate crimes are motivated by ethnicity bias, underscoring a significant concern for ethnically targeted offenses within the community. In contrast, hate crimes related to disability bias are the least reported, suggesting that this discrepancy may not solely reflect the actual prevalence of such crimes, but also highlight potential biases in measurement and reporting.

While hate crimes based on ethnicity can often manifest as attacks on community spaces—such as targeting mosques or cultural centers—disabled individuals frequently experience isolation, lacking the community structures that might support them in reporting incidents. This isolation can lead to underreporting of hate crimes, as many victims may not feel a sense of community or empowerment to come forward. Additionally, the unique barriers faced by individuals with disabilities, including fear of stigma and difficulties accessing reporting mechanisms, compound this issue.

This analysis calls for enhanced awareness and support systems to address all types of bias effectively. It is crucial to improve reporting mechanisms and increase public awareness of hate crimes, particularly those targeting ethnic minorities, to combat such offenses and promote a more inclusive society. By recognizing the complexities of both ethnicity and disability biases, we can better understand the full spectrum of hate crimes and advocate for comprehensive protections for all marginalized groups.

ChatGPT:
@fig-religion-bias illustrates the occurrences of hate crimes categorized by different religion bias types. The data reveals that, while a significant portion of hate crimes is directed toward individuals based on religion, Jewish individuals are disproportionately affected, facing the highest number of reported incidents. This trend underscores a critical concern regarding the targeting of Jewish communities, which highlights the ongoing issues of anti-Semitism within society.

The predominance of religion-related hate crimes emphasizes the urgent need for awareness and action to combat intolerance and discrimination. It suggests that targeted educational programs and community outreach initiatives are essential to address prejudice and foster understanding among diverse religious groups. By acknowledging these trends, stakeholders can develop more effective strategies to combat hate crimes and support affected communities, ultimately promoting inclusivity and respect for all religious identities.

User:
it shows that most hate crime toward Jewish happens in school, is rarely happened in cultural center

ChatGPT:
The filtered data reveals that hate crimes targeting Jewish individuals predominantly occur in schools, with educational institutions being a common setting for these offenses. This indicates that Jewish students and staff may be particularly vulnerable to hate crimes in these environments. In contrast, hate crimes at cultural centers are significantly less frequent, suggesting that such locations, which often serve as gathering places for Jewish communities, may be comparatively safer or less targeted. This discrepancy raises important questions about the types of environments where hate crimes are more likely to occur and may inform targeted efforts to improve safety and awareness in high-risk areas like schools.

ChatGPT:
@fig-Jewish-bias displays the percentage of hate crimes targeting Jewish individuals compared to other religious groups since 2018. The data reveals fluctuations in the proportion of hate crimes directed toward Jewish people. Specifically, the percentage has varied, with notable increases in certain years—rising from 70% in 2018 to 83% in 2022, followed by a slight decline to 78% in 2023. While this does not indicate a steady increase, it highlights consistent high levels of hate crimes against Jewish individuals, with occasional variations across the years. This trend suggests a sustained and significant targeting of the Jewish community.

Here are some additional tests and checks you might consider adding to further enhance the sanity check of your simulated data:

### Additional Tests

1. **Check for Outliers**: 
   - You can check for extreme values in numeric columns, such as the number of occurrences, to identify potential outliers that may affect your analysis.

   ```r
   outlier_checks <- simulated_data %>%
     summarise(across(where(is.numeric), ~ sum(. > quantile(., 0.99, na.rm = TRUE))))
   print("Number of outliers in numeric columns:")
   print(outlier_checks)
   ```

2. **Category Counts**: 
   - Count the occurrences of each category in bias columns to ensure they are within reasonable bounds and not excessively skewed toward one category.

   ```r
   bias_columns <- c("RACE_BIAS", "ETHNICITY_BIAS", "RELIGION_BIAS", 
                     "SEXUAL_ORIENTATION_BIAS", "GENDER_BIAS", 
                     "LANGUAGE_BIAS", "MENTAL_OR_PHYSICAL_DISABILITY")

   for (column in bias_columns) {
       cat_count <- table(simulated_data[[column]])
       print(paste("Counts for", column, ":"))
       print(cat_count)
   }
   ```

3. **Distribution of Years**: 
   - Analyze the distribution of occurrences by year to ensure there is no unusual bias toward certain years.

   ```r
   year_distribution <- table(simulated_data$OCCURRENCE_YEAR)
   print("Distribution of occurrences by year:")
   print(year_distribution)
   ```

4. **Cross-tabulation of Biases**: 
   - Create cross-tabulations between two or more bias categories to explore relationships and check for logical consistency.

   ```r
   cross_tab <- table(simulated_data$RACE_BIAS, simulated_data$GENDER_BIAS)
   print("Cross-tabulation of RACE_BIAS and GENDER_BIAS:")
   print(cross_tab)
   ```

5. **Check Column Types and Expected Values**: 
   - Ensure categorical variables are of type factor and check if they contain the expected levels.

   ```r
   for (column in bias_columns) {
       if (is.factor(simulated_data[[column]])) {
           expected_levels <- unique(cleaned_data[[column]])
           actual_levels <- levels(simulated_data[[column]])
           if (!all(expected_levels %in% actual_levels)) {
               print(paste("Warning: Missing levels in", column, ":", 
                           setdiff(expected_levels, actual_levels)))
           }
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Check for Valid Values in Categorical Columns**: 
   - Ensure that the values in categorical columns fall within the expected range. 

   ```r
   valid_categories <- list(
       GENDER_BIAS = c("None", "Women", "Men", "Non-Binary"),  # Adjust based on your data
       RACE_BIAS = c("None", "Black", "White", "Asian"),  # Adjust based on your data
       ETHNICITY_BIAS = c("None", "Jewish", "Hispanic"),  # Adjust based on your data
       # Add other columns as necessary
   )

   for (column in names(valid_categories)) {
       invalid_values <- setdiff(unique(simulated_data[[column]]), valid_categories[[column]])
       if (length(invalid_values) > 0) {
           print(paste("Invalid values in", column, ":", paste(invalid_values, collapse = ", ")))
       }
   }
   ```

7. **Temporal Trends**: 
   - If you have time-series data, consider plotting or summarizing the data to observe trends over time, which could indicate underlying issues or biases in the data.

8. **Proportion of Each Category**: 
   - Compute and print the proportions of each category to check if they meet your expected distribution.

   ```r
   for (column in bias_columns) {
       actual_counts <- table(simulated_data[[column]])
       proportions <- prop.table(actual_counts) * 100
       print(paste("Proportions for", column, ":"))
       print(proportions)
   }
   ```

### Summary

These additional tests will help ensure that your dataset is not only clean and free from errors but also behaves as expected concerning the distributions of different bias categories. This thorough examination will contribute to the robustness of your analysis and findings.

Feel free to mix and match any of these suggestions according to your specific requirements!
